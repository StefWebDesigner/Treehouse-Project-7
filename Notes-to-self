Things got work on: 
- fix chart 1 (768)



My initla suspsiouns:

768 overflow issue winner! >>>> 

<div class="chart-3-main divider divider-gap">
- seem slike lot of padding/margins

320 overflow issue >>>
the teramesasge issue


*** moving margin: auto made my header fluid

1024 is buggy and a cause for overflowing


the grid is found in the 320 viewport/// not 768 px;
----JUST ADD FUCKING GRID AREAS TO THE 768 PAGE!!!!!
---- THIS IS BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
