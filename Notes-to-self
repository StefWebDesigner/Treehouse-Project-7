NOTES OF RANDOM:
- if the 768 port reverst to the mobile format, it has to do with the added
status active code on the bottom of hourdata
- (768) my chart 1 changes from a small szie to bigger size if I click a navigation button 

DO SOME FUCKING SUB OPTIMIZATIONS!!!!!


NOTES OF GOOD NEWS: 
- 320 overflow issue was rooted to the font of the stupid email and profile labels in the setting
&*^& this
- (1024) Fxed stubborn the alert bar with a unnessary restricting width value
- (768) .traffic-header's gaps was the source of the overflow!!!!
- (768).chart-2-main, .chart-3-main are the source of the overflow 

NOTE OF BAD NEWS: 
- THE OVERFLWO ON THE 768/1024 ROOT FROM THE MESSEAGE/RECENT OR CHARTS

QUESTION:

why is my header elements not fluidily moving like the other elements on the page

==========================

---------- >>>> project review

Things got work on: 
- fix chart 1 (768)



My initla suspsiouns:

768 overflow issue winner! >>>> 

<div class="chart-3-main divider divider-gap">
- seem slike lot of padding/margins

320 overflow issue >>>
the teramesasge issue


*** moving margin: auto made my header fluid

1024 is buggy and a cause for overflowing


the grid is found in the 320 viewport/// not 768 px;
----JUST ADD FUCKING GRID AREAS TO THE 768 PAGE!!!!!
---- THIS IS BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
